Netflix Clone
This project is a basic front-end clone of the Netflix homepage. It was built using HTML and CSS as a practice project to learn more about web development.

Motivation
This was my first serious project, completed within a timeframe of just two days. As a beginner, I spent my time learning the basics of HTML and CSS, searching Google for every question I had. When Google or Stack Overflow didn't have the answer, YouTube became my last resort.

The process was challenging because I started with no clear plan on what I had to do. However, I slowly grasped the concepts, and line by line, the project came to life. While it may not be an outstanding feat to some, to me, it serves as a reminder that I can achieve anything I set my mind to.
